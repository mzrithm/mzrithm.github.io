If you're lucky, there are a couple of moments in your life where something magical happens. (Disclaimer: If you're very lucky, it happens all the time.) 

The magic of which I speak is completing a task and yearning to do it again. *Yearning* is a strong word, but it's the right word in this case. For example, I don't mind going out to the movies. I enjoy attending a concert. But finding a great book, curling up in a comfy chair with nothing but me, my dog, and a floor lamp putting a spotlight on the evening... that's some special sauce.

There are a lot of things I like about being a software engineer. I *love* Flutter.

I mean it. I love Flutter. But do I *yearn*...?

Maybe it's too soon to say... but I like where things are headed. 

Flutter is a Software Development Kit that allows intrepid engineers like me to build one app that compiles into native code for both iOS and Android devices. As an engineer, that means I get to work on one codebase while developing two mobile applications. Yes, it is as cool as it sounds.

Everything in the Flutter environment is a Widget. If you don't know what a Widget is, imagine a Lego made of code and you have a pretty good idea what I'm talking about. Widgets are components that meet different needs when you are building an application. Some Widgets are foundational like *Text* and *Image*. Some are more specialized like *Hero* and *NavigationRail*. They all come in the Flutter bucket, and if you know what you want to build, and you understand what different pieces are available to you, you can build... **anything**.

I didn't spend any time weighing the pros and cons of developing my app idea with Flutter versus developing with the alternatives. I don't have anything against React Native, Native iOS or Native Android and I'm not afraid of learning new things. I just found myself wanting to be back in the Flutter environment again. I wanted to challenge myself to go further with the knowledge I had already gained in my Mobile Development class. 

I have to confess, for me, that was a pretty special moment. I realized my decision was driven more by my desire to take a deeper dive into Dart and Flutter than any desire to avoid the burden of learning a new tech stack. I'm pretty sure that's where growth happens, and that is where I'm finding myself in these final days of my Bachelor's of Computer Science curriculum.

In a way, my real journey as a software engineer is only beginning now, as I anticipate heading out into the world to start working professionally on a codebase. I'm sure it's going to take me in a lot of different directions. I'm equally sure that over the course of my career I will fall in love again. And again. (With new tech stacks. It's pretty inevitable. I'm a big fan of the job, after all.) 

But I also know that... you *never* forget the first time.
