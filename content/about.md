Hey, there. I’m Michelle Zelechoski.

I’m an artist, a writer, and a late blooming software engineer. 

I’m currently studying Computer Science at Oregon State University and I live in the Greater Seattle Area.

I spend my free time writing code, playing with my dog, and caring for my flock of chickens.

```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

Thanks for being here!
